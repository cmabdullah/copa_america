	Lionel Messi - Argentina

For the Argentine marvel, this tournament has been defined by his scintillating 30 minutes against Panama, a feat that included three goals and one amazing pass to set up a fourth goal. The second goal, a sumptuous free kick was his best. Messi also played against Bolivia in the final group game, but was not as big a factor. The performance against Panama has been enough to make him look like the man of the tournament so far.

Pedro Gallese - Peru

For all of Messi's heroics, where would Peru be without its sterling goalkeeper? Not in the quarterfinals against Colombia. Gallese was the hero in the final game against Brazil, his best performance to date as he turned away one major scoring chance after another with almost impossible skill and reflexes. He had his solid moments against Ecuador and Haiti as well, but the Brazil performance was one of the best of any goal keeper in the tournament to date.

Clint Dempsey - U.S.

The America captain has been a beast throughout the tournament. He put in a solid shift against Colombia in the opener, creating a number of opportunities and then getting denied by a brilliant David Ospina in the second half. He scored a goal and set up two others against Costa Rica before scoring yet another winner in the final game against Paraguay. He has looked like a man on a mission and is undeniably one of the best this tournament has on offer.

James Rodriguez - Colombia

The maligned Real Madrid superstar was terrible in last year's showcase but has returned to peak form in this tournament. He was not great in the opener against the U.S. but was dominant in the second game against Paraguay, scoring and assisting in Colombia's 2-1 win. While he was not as at his best against Costa Rica, his arrival on the pitch alongside attacking mates Edwin Cardona and Juan Cuadrado sparked Colombia to life.

Alexis Sanchez - Chile

It is tough to pick between Chile's two superstars, but the Arsenal attacker was a factor throughout the three games. He set up the penalty against Bolivia and then scored two goals and essentially created another in the 4-2 win over Panama.
